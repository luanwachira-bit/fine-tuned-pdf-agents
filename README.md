# AI Document Intelligence

An advanced AI agent designed to read, understand, and answer questions about domain-specific PDF documents. This project leverages fine-tuned language models from Hugging Face for expertise in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Cybersecurity.



## ðŸš€ Features

-   **Modular Agent Design:** Easily extendable system with a `BaseAgent` class.
-   **Domain Specialization:** Create separate agents for different fields (ML, Data Science, CyberSec).
-   **PDF Text Extraction:** Reads content directly from PDF files.
-   **Extractive Q&A:** Uses pre-trained Hugging Face models to find answers within the document text.
-   **Fine-Tuning Ready:** Stubbed-out methods to easily add model fine-tuning logic.
